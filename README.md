Hacking By The See hackathon solution 

# Assigment
Lego Mindstorms is a popular platform for learning about robotics and programming. It allows users to build a variety of robots and control them

# Description
In this hackathon, we challenge you to take this a step further by developing a system that allows a Lego Mindstorms car to be controlled using voice commands.
Goal: The challenge for this hackathon is to develop a voice-controlled system for a Lego Mindstorms car. The system should be able to interpret a set of predefined voice commands and translate them into actions performed by the car. The commands should include at least the basic movements such as "move forward", "move backward", "turn left", "turn right", and
"stop". Other goals are to create a digital twin of the car to track its movements. This can be done through a web application or a VR/AR application.
Preparation: Look into existing voice-controlled robotics solutions to understand their strengths and weaknesses. This could include commercial solutions like voice-controlled drones or open-source projects on platforms like GitHub.
Inspiration: To really win over the jury, you should aim for a live demo of your solution. Think about how your solution could support multiple languages. This could make your solution more universally applicable and could open up new applications in language learning or international
